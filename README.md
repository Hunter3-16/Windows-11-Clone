# Description:
The Windows 11 Clone in Browser project is an ambitious endeavor to replicate the user interface and functionalities of the Windows 11 operating system entirely within a web browser environment. It combines the power of modern web technologies such as ReactJS and Tailwind CSS to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

# Key Features:

**User Interface Mimicry:** The project meticulously replicates the visual elements of the Windows 11 operating system, including the Start Menu, Taskbar, File Explorer, and Window Management, ensuring users feel familiar with the interface.

**Functional Command Prompt:** One of the standout features is the fully functional Command Prompt, enabling users to execute commands just like they would in a traditional Windows environment. This includes common commands for file manipulation, system configuration, and more.

**Integrated Chrome Browser:** To enhance the user experience, the project incorporates an integrated Chrome Browser, allowing users to browse the web seamlessly without leaving the Windows 11 environment. This browser integration ensures a cohesive experience for users.

**Taskbar with Essential Functionalities:** The Taskbar provides quick access to essential applications and system utilities, allowing users to switch between tasks effortlessly. It also includes features such as pinned applications, system tray icons, and a notification area for enhanced productivity.

**Notification Panel with Login PIN Functionality:** The Notification Panel serves as a centralized hub for system notifications, alerts, and messages. Additionally, it includes login PIN functionality, offering an extra layer of security for users accessing the system.
